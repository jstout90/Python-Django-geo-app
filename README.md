## Python-Django-geo-app
Python/Django web app that gets current position and displays location on a map.  Also gets the weather for current location.

## Motivation
Becoming a better developer.  Learning and creating my own software instead of buying it.

## Build status
Current build is complete.  One of the api's is using HTTP which prevents the whole project from working properly.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/)

## Features
Simple weather app that uses different api's to get location and display weather.

## Installation
Uses Python 3. PIP install requirements.txt file.  Must have an account on Open Weather Map and ipstack to get a api key.
